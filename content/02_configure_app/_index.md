## Install and Deploy To-Do Application

In this section, we will understand the deployment template and our project structure. It is pretty simple todo-app that uses aws resurces.

Then, we will integrate Thundra APM to our lambda functions by using the SAM configuration of Thundra APM.

Finally, we simply will trigger our lambda functions and check what will we see in the Thundra console.

Now lets start with clonning the demo project.
