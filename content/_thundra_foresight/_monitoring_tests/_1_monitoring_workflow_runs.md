# Monitoring Workflow Runs

This page is pretty clear on what it offers. In this page, you'll see your latest GitHub Action workflow runs. You have the **Workflow Success Rate** and **Workflow Run Duration** graphs that are calculated every time you get a new workflow run.

Your screen might look a bit different as I did some testing to populate the metrics and such. When we take a look at the graphs, we see the **Workflow Success Rate** which shows the overall success rate for your latest 14 runs. **Workflow Run Duration** will only take the successful runs into account, as failed runs won't give us a meaningful duration metric.

Let's dive into the tests section and see our test results in detail as well.
