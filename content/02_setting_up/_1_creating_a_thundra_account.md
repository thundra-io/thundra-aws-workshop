# Thundra Account

Currently, a **Thundra** account is an umbrella account that'll give you access to the three sub-product Thundra has.

To sign up, you can simply go to [start.thundra.io](https://start.thundra.io) and choose your preffered way of authentication.

After signing in, you'll see a screen where you have to choose different products. In this workshop, we'll primarily focus on Thundra Foresight.

Thundra Foresight is our CI and Test monitoring tool that's powered by Thundra APM behind the curtain. With Thundra Foresight, you'll be able to see your CI status, test runs, and end-to-end test traces in detail.

Once our account is created, let's choose **Thundra Foresight** for now and get to work.
