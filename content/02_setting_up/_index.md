# Setting Up

Before we go on further, we need one more thing.

We need to open up an account at [**Thundra**](https://start.thundra.io) and create a project in [**Thundra Foresight**](https://foresight.thundra.io).

Once this is done, we can get the API Key and the Project ID to set them in the `Makefile` of our project.
